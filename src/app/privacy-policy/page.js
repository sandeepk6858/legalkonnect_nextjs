<h2 className='mt-[40px]'><strong>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong></h2>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'><em>When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you. This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the LegalKonnect platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms. When you use the Service, we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with information about other users. This helps us improve our Services for you. You may also provide us with information about your contacts or friends if, for example, you’d like to add those contacts to a message room. Agencies may also provide us with information about legal service providers/legal service provider/legal service provider/freelancers associated with the Agency.</em></p>
<ul className='list-disc'>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'><strong>Personal Information :</strong> While using the Service (whether as a Client or legal service provider/freelancer or Agency), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Payment<strong> </strong>Information :&nbsp;</strong>If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Identity Verification :&nbsp;</strong>We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Biometric Identifiers or Service Interaction Information :&nbsp;</strong>We may collect Personal Information to verify your identity and to detect fraud, identity theft, or other misuse of your account through facial recognition and other technologies.This might be a photograph of your face, a selfie, or data about your interactions with the Service.We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued ID. From time to time, LegalKonnect may require you to take and submit another or updated image of your face for comparison to your government-issued ID. The biometric identifiers or information collected are used only to verify your identity and platform security and use integrity purposes.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>General Audience Service :</strong>&nbsp;The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that LegalKonnect has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at: <Link href="mailto:legalnotices@upwork.com">info@LegalKonnect .com </Link>.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Non-Identifying Information/Usernames :&nbsp;</strong>We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information about your use of the Service, and general project-related data (“<strong>Non-Identifying</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Information</strong>”). We may combine information collected from LegalKonnect users, whether they are registered or not&nbsp;(“<strong>LegalKonnect </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Users</strong>”). In some cases, we may render Personal Information (generally, email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as “ Hashed Information.” This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information :&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes when non-identifying information is combined, it can identify an individual. For example, if a birthdate is combined with a first name, it might identify a person even if the birthday or first name alone could not. But the same pieces of information are considered Non- Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but LegalKonnect will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Collection</strong><strong> </strong><strong>of</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Third</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Party</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Personal<strong> </strong>Information :&nbsp;</strong>We collect the following personal information from you about your contacts or friends: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a message room.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'>You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will not be able to provide our Service to you. If you have any questions regarding whether provision of information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><strong><em>Information Received from Third Parties</em></strong></h3>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'><em>Third</em><em> </em><em>parties</em><em> </em><em>may</em><em> </em><em>also</em><em> </em><em>give</em><em> </em><em>us</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>about</em><em> </em><em>you.</em><em> </em><em>If</em><em> </em><em>we</em><em> </em><em>combine</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>about</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>collected</em><em> </em><em>through</em><em> </em><em>the</em><em> </em><em>Service,</em><em> </em><em>we</em><em> </em><em>will</em><em> </em><em>still</em><em> </em><em>treat</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>combined</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>as</em><em> </em><em>set</em><em> </em><em>forth</em><em> </em><em>in</em><em> </em><em>this</em><em> </em><em>Privacy</em><em> </em><em>Policy.</em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service). If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><em><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></em></h3>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'><em>Like</em><em> </em><em>other</em><em> </em><em>online</em><em> </em><em>companies,</em><em> </em><em>we</em><em> </em><em>receive</em><em> </em><em>technical</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>when</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>use</em><em> </em><em>our</em><em> </em><em>Services.</em><em> </em><em>We</em><em> </em><em>use</em><em> </em><em>these</em><em> </em><em>technologies</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save your log-in information for future</em><em> </em><em>sessions,</em><em> </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>serve</em><em> </em><em>you</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> </em><em>advertisements</em><em> </em><em>that</em><em> </em><em>may</em><em> </em><em>interest</em><em> </em><em>you.</em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links you clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other similar information and statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors and length of visits to certain pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.</p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>”) address or other unique device identifier (“<strong>Device</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Identifier</strong>”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service.</p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'><strong><em>LegalKonnect and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movement around the website, the desktop app, and the mobile app, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The technology used to collect information automatically from LegalKonnect Users may include the following:</em></strong></p>
<ul className='list-disc'>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'><strong>Cookies :&nbsp;</strong>Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the LegalKonnect Terms of Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how LegalKonnect Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by LegalKonnect Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service.</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Web Beacons :&nbsp;</strong>We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how LegalKonnect Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
	</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>
	<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><strong>Embedded Scripts :&nbsp;</strong>We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'>In addition, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may use a variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><strong><em>HOW</em><em> </em><em>WE</em><em> </em><em>RESPOND</em><em> </em><em>TO</em><em> </em><em>DO</em><em> </em><em>NOT</em><em> </em><em>TRACK</em><em> </em><em>SIGNALS</em></strong></h3>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><em>LegalKonnect </em><em> </em><em>does</em><em> </em><em>not</em><em> </em><em>respond</em><em> </em><em>to</em><em> </em><em>Do-Not-Track</em><em> </em><em>signals.</em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, LegalKonnect does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><em><strong>User Profiles</strong></em></h3>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><em>Legal service provider/legal service provider/freelancers</em><em> </em><em>may</em><em> </em><em>create</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>profile,</em><em> </em><em>with</em><em> </em><em>certain</em><em> </em><em>or</em><em> </em><em>all</em><em> </em><em>information</em><em> </em><em>publicly</em><em> </em><em>available.</em><em> </em><em>Clients</em><em> </em><em>and</em><em> </em><em>Agencies</em><em> </em><em>may</em><em> </em><em>also</em><em> </em><em>create</em><em> </em><em>organization</em><em> </em><em>profiles.</em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously performed via the Service and outside the Service, skills, tests taken, test scores, hourly pay rates and earnings information, feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“<strong>Profile</strong>”). The information in your Profile may be visible to all LegalKonnect Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your LegalKonnect Profile. You may edit certain information in your Profile via your account and may choose to limit who is able to view certain content you post to your Profile. Clients and Agencies of associated individual users or companies may also have the opportunity to create an organization Profile.

<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[20px]'><em><strong>Identity</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><em><strong>Verification</strong></em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px]'><em><strong>We place a premium on trust in our Service, so we may take steps to verify your identity.</strong></em></p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>Before a Legal service provider/legal service provider/freelancer can complete registration on the Service, or at any time thereafter, we may request or re-request identity verification. Without limiting the manner in which we request identify verification, we may require legal service provider/freelancers to&nbsp;participate in a video call after submitting their government issued ID to enable us to confirm that the legal service provider/freelancer is indeed the individual in the ID. We may record such video calls and take screenshots of the user during the call. LegalKonnect may use the information obtained from Identity Verification for purposes of verifying your identity, enforcing our Terms of Service and other agreements, and preventing fraud.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><em><strong>Messaging</strong></em></h3>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>Legal service providers/freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may communicate with each other through the Service. For example, Legal service providers/freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may wish to discuss Client needs and Legal service providers/freelancer work proposals. If you communicate with an Agency or Client, that Agency or Client will also be a “data controller” with respect to such communications.</p>
<h3 className='mt-[20px]'><em><strong>Community Forums</strong></em></h3>

<ul  className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px] list-disc m-[20px]'>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.</li>
	<li className='mt-[20px]'>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>

	</li>
</ul>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights.</p>
<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through email us at <Link href="mailto:privacyrequests@upwork.com">info@LegalKonnect .com. </Link>You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.

<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.

<p className='text-[16px] leading-[28px] mt-[10px]'>The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information. Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months.</p>
